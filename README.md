# Crunchyroll-Rich-Presence 
An Crunchyroll app wrapper with Rich Presence Discord.

# I dooooon't wannaaaaaa reeeeeaaaaad everythiiiiiiingggggggg! 
You can download a prebuilt installer from [releases](https://github.com/ElBuenAnvita/Crunchyroll-Rich-Presence/releases) if you want.
We don't have a official licence for our product (This app is totally $0!)

# Building yourself (This is a copypaste!)

## Prepairing the environment
You will need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/en/download) installed and added to the PATH, so just download the installer and make sure to select the box to add to PATH. Version must be 7.0.0 >

## Running
You have to install the dependencies. So, just run `npm install` in the repo's folder.
Once it's done, run `npm start` to start the application.

## Building
The app also have a build method, used for distribution. It will generate a NSIS installer for the app, and a packaged version of it.
To build the app for distribution, run `npm run dist`.

# Info
Based on [discord-netflix](https://github.com/nirewen/discord-netflix) for this code. (Thank youuu nirewen~!)

# Heads up!
If Discord is not opened, or, for some reason, the RPC Client couldn't connect to it, Rich Presence won't work.
Even if Discord is not opened, you can still use the app as a normal Crunchyroll wrapper.

The timestamp and RP won't work if you're watching a video longer than 1 hour (1:00:00).

# Features
This app only show on Discord Rich Presence "In Catalogs" and mangas o shows you're watching (and the timestamp if is available).<br>

## Planned
- Show episode name (Actually only shows series, episode number, episode name and timestamp)
- Translated Rich Presence.<br>
- An smallkey for Premium and Premium+ users.<br>
- FlashPlayer include for read manga.<br>

Any ideas? Please tell us!
